<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surface Drilling Rigs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Top-Hammer</li><li>Down-the-Hole</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surface drilling rigs are categorized into two main types based on the drilling method used: top-hammer and down-the-hole. Top-hammer rigs use a hammer located at the top of the drill string to break the rock, while down-the-hole rigs have the hammer located at the bottom of the drill string. Top-hammer rigs are generally preferred for softer formations and shallower depths, while down-the-hole rigs are better suited for harder formations and deeper drilling. Both types play a crucial role in the surface drilling rigs market catering to different geological conditions and drilling requirements.</p></p>
