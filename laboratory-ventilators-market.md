<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laboratory Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CMV</li><li>AMV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Laboratory ventilators play a crucial role in providing respiratory support in clinical settings. There are two main types of laboratory ventilators - CMV (controlled mechanical ventilation) and AMV (assist mode ventilation). CMV ventilators deliver a set tidal volume at a predetermined rate, while AMV ventilators synchronize with the patient's breathing efforts to provide additional support as needed. Both types of ventilators are essential in managing patients with respiratory distress or failure, ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation.</p></p>
