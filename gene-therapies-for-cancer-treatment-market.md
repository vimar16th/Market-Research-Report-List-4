<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Therapies for Cancer Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Somatic Cell Gene Therapy (SCGT)</li><li>Germline Gene Therapy (GGT)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gene therapies for cancer treatment can be classified into two main types: Somatic Cell Gene Therapy (SCGT) and Germline Gene Therapy (GGT). SCGT involves targeting specific cancer cells within the body, while GGT involves editing the DNA of reproductive cells to prevent cancer from being passed on to future generations. Both types of gene therapy offer exciting potential for the treatment and prevention of cancer, although GGT raises ethical concerns due to the permanent changes made to an individual's genetic makeup.</p></p>
