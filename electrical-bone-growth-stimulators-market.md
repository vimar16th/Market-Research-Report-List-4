<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrical Bone Growth Stimulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Type</li><li>Implanted Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>External Type Electrical Bone Growth Stimulators are devices that are worn outside the body and usually placed over the skin of the fractured area. These devices deliver low-level electrical currents to stimulate bone healing. </p><p>Implanted Type Electrical Bone Growth Stimulators are devices that are surgically implanted directly onto the surface of the bone or within the bone itself. These devices deliver electrical stimulation directly to the site of the fracture to promote healing. Both types of devices are used to accelerate the healing process in fractures that are slow to heal or have difficulty healing on their own.</p></p>
