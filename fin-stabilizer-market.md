<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fin Stabilizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Retractable Fin Stabilizers</li><li>Non-Retractable Fin Stabilizers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fin stabilizers are divided into two types based on their design - retractable fin stabilizers and non-retractable fin stabilizers. Retractable fin stabilizers can be adjusted and retracted into the hull of the ship when not in use, providing flexibility and reducing drag. On the other hand, non-retractable fin stabilizers remain fixed in place and are always deployed while the ship is in motion. Both types of fin stabilizers help reduce the rolling motion of a ship in rough seas, providing stability and comfort for passengers and crew.</p></p>
