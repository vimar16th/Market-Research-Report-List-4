<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Time-Domain</li><li>Frequency-Domain</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) is used for studying molecular interactions and dynamics in biological samples by measuring the fluorescence lifetime of fluorophores. There are two main types of FLIM: Time-Domain and Frequency-Domain. Time-Domain FLIM measures the time taken for a fluorophore to return to its ground state after excitation, providing high spatial resolution. Frequency-Domain FLIM uses modulated excitation light to measure the phase shift of emitted fluorescence, allowing for faster imaging speeds and improved signal-to-noise ratio. Both techniques have their own advantages and applications in the field of biological imaging.</p></p>
