<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chip Level Underfill Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fluid Filler</li><li>Non Flowing Filler</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chip level underfill is a type of material used in electronic packaging to enhance the reliability and performance of semiconductor devices. There are two main types of chip level underfill markets: Fluid Filler and Non-Flowing Filler. </p><p>Fluid filler is a liquid material that flows and fills gaps between the chip and substrate during the curing process, providing better mechanical strength and thermal cycling performance. Non-flowing filler, on the other hand, is a solid material that is applied in a viscous form and does not flow during curing, making it ideal for applications where flow control is critical.</p></p>
