<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Gas Refueling Stations Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CNG</li><li>LNG</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Natural gas refueling stations can be classified into two main types: Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) markets. CNG stations compress natural gas to reduce its volume for efficient storage and refueling of vehicles, making it suitable for smaller fleets and urban areas. On the other hand, LNG stations liquefy natural gas for easier transport and storage, catering to larger fleets and long-haul trucking operations. Both types play a significant role in promoting the use of natural gas as a cleaner alternative fuel option.</p></p>
