<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Admittance Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Zero Pressure</li><li>Positive Pressure</li><li>Negative Pressure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Air Admittance Valves are categorized into three market types based on pressure conditions: Zero Pressure, Positive Pressure, and Negative Pressure. Zero Pressure valves are designed for applications where there is no pressure in the drainage system. Positive Pressure valves are used in systems where there is higher pressure within the pipes, preventing the backflow of water or gases. Negative Pressure valves are ideal for systems with lower pressure, allowing proper ventilation and preventing siphoning of water. Each market type serves a specific purpose based on pressure conditions in the drainage system.</p></p>
